## Documentation functions
Only two functions!

@subscribe(<name event>)
With this decorator you can subscribe to all events that are sent to <name event>

send(<name event>, *args, **kwargs)
If caught in a parameter called instant in kwargs with True call is placed in a new thread

* Note: Currently running as thread to allow sharing of memory, if you want an event to use more CPU (cores), you can run processes within the event.
