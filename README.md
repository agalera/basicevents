## Documentation functions
Only two functions!

@subscribe(name_event)
With this decorator you can subscribe to all events that are sent to name_event.

send(name_event, *args, **kwargs)
If caught in a parameter called instant in kwargs with True call is placed in a new thread.

* Note: Currently running as thread to allow sharing of memory, if you want an event to use more CPU (cores), you can run processes within the event.
